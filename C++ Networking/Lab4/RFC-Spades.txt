2. Basic Operation
	
	This document specifies how clients and servers will interact
	according to the Spades Protocol. 
	
	Commands in Spades consist of a case-sentitive keyword, possibly
	followed by one argument.
	Keywords and arguments consist of printble ASCII characters.
	Keywords and arguments are each separated by a single SPACE
	character.
        Keywords are 4 characters long.
	Each argument will be 1 or 2 characters long.
	Client messages are terminated with <crlf>.
	
	Responses in Spades 
	All server responses end in a <crlf>.
        Reponses may be up to 254 characters long (256 with <crlf>).
	There are currently two status indicators: positive ("+")
	and negative ("-"). Servers must send status keywords
 	in uppercase.

	When the Spades server comes online, it will be running in the
	CONNECTION state. In this state, the server will accept PLYR, OBSV,
	and QUIT commands. When a client signs in, the server will generate
	a welcome message to the client. It will then respond to the previously
	stated commands with either a "+PLYR" followed by a message or a "-" 
	followed by a message.

	Once all player spots have been filled, the server will enter the
	SET-UP state. In this state, the server will choose a player as a dealer
	and dealcards appropriately. The server will the move on to the BIDDING state. 

	In the BIDDING state, the server now allows players and observers to chat
	and collects bids from all the players. Once all bids are in it moves on
	to the PLAY state.

	In the PLAY state, the server continues to allow players to chat but now allows
	players to play cards.

	When the 13th trick ends, the server enters the PROCESSING state and determines
	whether the game has ended or just the round. If the game has completed, the server
	messages all players and observers and resets to the BIDDING state. If the round
	ended, the game returns to the BIDDING state.

---------------------------------------------------------------[2]

3. The CONNECTION state

	While in this state, the server is accepting 3 commands. PLYR,
	OBSV, and QUIT. Whenever a connection is made, the server will
	respond with a greeting.
		
		Example: "+PLYR Welcome to the Spades server, we hope you enjoy the game!"

	On PLYR command, if it is given with no arguments, the server will
	choose the first player slot that is available and assign
	the client to be that player. The server will then return a "+PLYR" saying
	that the client has been assigned to the particular player. If an argument
	is given, the server will check if that particular slot is open, if so
	it will send a "+PLYR" that they have been assigned to that player. If either
	of these fail, the server will return a "-" saying that all positions are filled
	or that the one specificed is filled and the server will state which slots
	are still open.

	The server will accept all OBSV commands from new connections.

	If a player or observer want to change their roles, they will need to 
	send a QUIT command to have their connection shut down so they can
	reconnect with the new role.

--------------------------------------------------------------[3]

4. The SET-UP state
	
	Once all player slots have been assigned, the server will enter
	the SET-UP state and will no longer accept incoming connections.

	Once all players are accounted for, the server will choose a player
	at random to be the psuedo dealer. The server will then deal starting
	with the next player and will rotate in the same order between games.

	The server will send each player their hand like so:

		Example: HA TS 9C 4H

---------------------------------------------------------------[4]

The BIDDING state

	Once all players have received their hand, the server enters
	the BIDDING state.

	In this state, the server will ask each player, in the same
	order the cards were delt, what they would like to bid. The server
	broadcasts each bid to both the chat channel and to each player.
	
	Each player will bid with the IBID command

		Example: IBID 05

	Also, the CHAT command is now available. Typing CHAT followed
	by a string of up to 254 characters will have a message sent out
	to the chat channel.
		
		Example: CHAT Hello everyone

	Typing QUIT in the BIDDING state closes the connection to the
	server. If QUIT was typed by player, the game broadcasts out 
	that a player has left and the server returns to the CONNECTION state. 
	If QUIT was typed by a OBSV, the game stays in the current state.

----------------------------------------------------------------[5]

The PLAY state

	Once all bids have been placed, the server enters the PLAY state.

	Continuing in the same player order as before, the server asks
	each player to play a card. The server checks the card played against
	what it knows the player to have and to what they have already played
	returning "-" if the move is invalid. Once a correct move is played,
	the server broadcasts that card to all other players and chat.

	This rotation continues until all cards have been played by each player.

	To play a card, the client can type:

		CARD AH

	CHAT is still allowed in the PLAY state and QUIT continues to operate
	as it did in the BIDDING state.

----------------------------------------------------------------[6]

The Processing state

	Once all cards have been played, the server enters the Processing state.
	Once the server has determined whether the total has been reached or not,
	it either sends a game over message to players and chat with statistics
	about the results or returns to the bidding state to start the next round.
