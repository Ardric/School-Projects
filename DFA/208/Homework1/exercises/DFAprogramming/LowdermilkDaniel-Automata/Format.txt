The format for NFA's is the same as the DFA textfiles except that it was one extra
	state per line compared to the alphabet.  This is for the lambda option. 
	-1 is to symbolise where you have two or more choices on where to transition to.
	For example in state 0 if you see a 1, you can go to state 0 or 1.  -2 represents
	where the choice wasn't  made clear.  So for example on line 4, in the drawn NFA
	you arn't given a place to go if you see a 1.

instead of g++ on the command line my code compiles with "compile" rather than "g++".
